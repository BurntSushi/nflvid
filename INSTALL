You should install nflvid using pip, which will automatically install 
dependencies for you from PyPI:

  sudo pip2 install nflvid

(Use `pip2` when Python 3 is the default Python installation on your system.
You can discover this by running `pip --help` and seeing which version of 
Python it's using. If it's 3.x, then you'll need to install a Python 2 version 
of pip which is usually called `pip2`.)

If you don't want to use pip, you can install nflvid manually by cloning the
repository and installing with setuptools:

  git clone git://github.com/BurntSushi/nflvid
  cd nflvid
  sudo python2 setup.py install

But this will require that you install all of the dependencies yourself 
(through pip or your package manager). The dependencies are listed in the 
README and are all available on PyPI.

Note that in order to actually process video footage, you will need ffmpeg,
imagemagick and rtmpdump installed on your machine too.

After installation, you should now be able to run a Python interpreter and 
e.g., find out the URL of an HLS stream of an NFL game:

[andrew@Liger ~] python2
Python 2.7.5 (default, May 12 2013, 12:00:47) 
[GCC 4.8.0 20130502 (prerelease)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import nflgame
>>> import nflvid
>>> g = nflgame.one(2012, 5, 'NE', 'NE')
>>> print nflvid.footage_url(g)
