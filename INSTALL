It should be as straight-forward as

  sudo python2 setup.py install

You should now be able to run a Python interpreter and e.g., find out
the URL of an HLS stream of an NFL game:

[andrew@Liger ~] python2
Python 2.7.5 (default, May 12 2013, 12:00:47) 
[GCC 4.8.0 20130502 (prerelease)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import nflgame
>>> import nflvid
>>> g = nflgame.one(2012, 5, 'NE', 'NE')
>>> print nflvid.footage_url(g)
