Game keys must be retrieved for every game played. Each game key will require a 
one time request to a URL like:

  http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2012100709/2012/REG5

The components of the URL can be constructed from data in nflgame/schedule.py.

The actual game key can be found in a comment like so:

  <!-- gamekey : 55577 -->

These IDs are what the Neulion content provider uses to identify games. Note 
that the existence of a `gamekey` in a GameCenter page does not necessarily 
mean there is NFL Game Rewind data. In particular, at this moment in time, it 
appears that only the 2012 season is publicly available.

The gamekey should be associated with the appropriate game in 
nflgame/schedule.py.

The game key can now be used to access play meta data via an XML API:

  http://smbsolr.cdnak.neulion.com/solr/nflplay/select?fl=*&rows=1000&q=GameId:55577

The key pieces of information here are contained within each `<doc>...</dov>` 
node. Namely, the `ArchiveTCIN` and `PlayID` fields. The `ArchiveTCIN` field 
provides the exact seek time in the video in which the play begins, while the 
`PlayID` field (in combination with the gamekey) uniquely identifies a single 
play from the GameCenter JSON data.

Thus, play data in `nflgame` can now be trivially mapped to video of that play.
