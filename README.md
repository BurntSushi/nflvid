nflvid is a Python package that facilates the processing of NFL game footage. 
In particular, this library provides routines to do the following:

  - Download game footage from NFL's content provider (Neulion).

  - Download play meta data associated with game footage that, among other 
    things, describes the start time of every play in the game.

  - Cut the game footage into pieces where each piece corresponds to a single 
    game.

  - Provide a simple command line interface to search plays and access the game 
    footage for each play.

The methods used in this library rely heavily on the open availability of data 
that could be shut off at any time. More to the point, the content that this 
library requires is large and cannot be distributed easily. Therefore, this 
package's future remains uncertain.

Installation, documentation and usage instructions are forthcoming.
